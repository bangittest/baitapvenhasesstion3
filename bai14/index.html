    <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood?</p> 
    This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.
    <div>
        documents. These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs
        break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of
        the text. What you are seeing are the browser's default styles — very basic styles — that the browser applies to HTML to
        make sure that the page will be basically readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.
